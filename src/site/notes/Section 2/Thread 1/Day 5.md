### Thread 1, Day 5 - Wednesday, October 26, 2022
#### Agenda
1. Name Plate
	- Make a final set of enhancements to your Name Plate sketch – or – keep your existing sketch and start a new one, in another Playground file, with a different visual look and feel.
	- To build and show your increasing mastery of concepts we've recently looked at, aim to use some or all of these techniques:
		- [[Concepts/Iteration\|iteration]]
		- [[Concepts/Functions\|functions]]
		- [[Concepts/Random Numbers\|random numbers]]
		- [[Radial Fill Plan\|a rough plan]]
	- Remember that you can use [colour combination websites](https://www.canva.com/learn/100-color-combinations/) and [[Using the Eyedropper Tool to Obtain Nice Colours\|the eyedropper tool to obtain nice colours]] for your sketches.
		- When choosing a color, the *alpha*  or *opacity* value refers to how transparent the colour will be.
		> [!Tip]
		> Try overlapping two filled figures that use a slightly transparent colour. What happens?
	- Here are some ideas that might be fun to use as inspiration, if you are searching for an idea!
		- To implement these patterns, think of how you might use fills and overlapping shapes.
